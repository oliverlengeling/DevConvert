# IMPORTANT: The GUI version is no longer supported and will remain as is..

In the "Stable" tag the GUI version with limited capabilities is available in the source code.

Non-GUI Version: Compile and boom thats it.

The non-GUI version has more features like setting sales tax percentage from the default of 7% and is more intuitive.
