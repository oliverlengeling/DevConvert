# IMPORTANT: The GUI version is no longer supported and will remain as is. All future updates will go into the convert.py file.

GUI Version: Compile using python 3 with tkinter installed if not already.
Non-GUI Version: Compile and boom thats it.

The non-GUI version has more features like setting sales tax percentage from the default of 7% and is more intuitive.

### Install:
1. Unzip source code
2. Compile the version of your choosing using, python "convert.py" or python "gui.py"
3. Use it
