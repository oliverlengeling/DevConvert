# IMPORTANT: The GUI version is no longer supported and will remain as is. All future updates will go into the convert.py file.

In the "Stable" tag the GUI version with limited capabilities is available in the source code.

GUI Version: Compile using python 3 with tkinter installed if not already.
Non-GUI Version: Compile and boom thats it.

The non-GUI version has more features like setting sales tax percentage from the default of 7% and is more intuitive.

### Install:
1. Unzip source code
2. Compile the version of your choosing using, python "convert.py" or python "gui.py"
3. Use it
